# data_publicFederal Repository

This repository contains various public datasets related to Minnesota data but is steward by Federal Agencies such as the Census Bureau and CDC.
   - Just like everything on the internet, links can eventually become outdated or broken.
      - If any of the links stop workinging please submit an issue. 
   - My hope is that all Federal agencies and Federal data is stored like the Census Bureau API. The Census Bureau API can be pulled directly into R and Python without the need for an access token.

## Usage

By converting these data sets to a csv format, programs like R and Python are able to pull the data directly into applications.  
Each respective department was reached out to to make sure it is okay to redisplay the data in a more friendly format.
