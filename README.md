# data_publicFederal Repository

This repository hosts a variety of public datasets related to Minnesota, managed by federal agencies like the Census Bureau and CDC.
   - Just like everything on the internet, links can eventually become outdated or broken.
      - If any of the links stop workinging please submit an issue. 
   - My hope is that all Federal agencies and Federal data is stored like the Census Bureau API. The Census Bureau API can be pulled directly into R and Python without the need for an access token.

Each department was contacted to ensure approval for redisplaying the data in a more user-friendly format.
