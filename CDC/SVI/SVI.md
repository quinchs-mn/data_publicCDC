# Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) Project

**Website:** [CDC/ATSDR SVI Interactive Map](https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html)

## Overview
The Social Vulnerability Index (SVI) is a tool developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR). It is designed to help public health officials and local planners identify and support communities that are most vulnerable to hazardous events, such as natural disasters, disease outbreaks, or chemical spills.

## Purpose
The SVI aims to:
- Reduce human suffering and economic loss.
- Enhance public health preparedness and response.
- Address health inequities by identifying socially vulnerable populations.

## Methodology
The SVI uses 16 U.S. census variables grouped into four themes:
1. **Socioeconomic Status**: Includes factors like poverty, unemployment, and income.
2. **Household Composition & Disability**: Considers age, disability, and single-parent households.
3. **Minority Status & Language**: Accounts for racial/ethnic minority status and English proficiency.
4. **Housing Type & Transportation**: Looks at housing density, multi-unit structures, and vehicle access.

These variables are combined to create an overall social vulnerability score for each census tract.

## Note
When I get more time, I plan to pull this data directly from the Census Bureau API since the SVI Project does such a great job with their data dictionary and allowing for reproducibility.
